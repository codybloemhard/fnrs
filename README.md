# fnrs
Some rusty functions that I fancy...
## Func
Trait with some common functions like map,filter,fold, etc.
I don't like ```vec.iter().map().collect()```, to much stuff.
Only for ```Copy``` types, for the borrow checker has defeated me in my trails.
## Sequence
Some functions for related to... sequences.
